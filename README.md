# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is designed for people who want to learn algorithms and data structures and understand how they work from the inside. All implementations are written in C++ using classes and vectors, though some algorithms (like BFS and DFS) could be implemented without classes, and some data structures (like DP tables) could use arrays instead of vectors.

New algorithms and data structures will be added continuously over time. The goal is to create a comprehensive repository with a variety of algorithms and data structures that will help you understand their inner workings.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer, such as Clang or GCC.

### Compilation and Execution

#### Using Clang:

```bash
clang++ name_of_file.cpp -o name_of_file
./name_of_file
```

#### Using GCC:

```bash
g++ name_of_file.cpp -o name_of_file
./name_of_file
```

**Note:** The first command compiles the file, and the second one runs the compiled code.
